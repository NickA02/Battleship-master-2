# Battleship
<br>
In order to use, in ai.py change line 37's 'hunt3_ai.h5' to whichever model you want to use (all_ai.h5, all2_ai.h5, bship_ai.h5, cb_ai.h5, dia.h5, hunt_ai.h5, hunt2_ai.h5, or hunt3_ai.h5) then run main. The program will not select intial ship locations or the first move(s), so make sure to select them.
